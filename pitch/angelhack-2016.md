Trust/reputation score based on person's online presence

General Use Case:
Validate trustworthness of a person met online

DEMO

Eventhought score will be based very stronly on persons presence on online economy platforms I'm not calling it a credit score as this is not meant to be used by Fin Ins and I don't want to mess with FCA

there is a HUGE market demand for a product like this! competition exists but there is no market leader yet. Working with my genius friend Nuno who couldn't be here today I have all skills to make WebTruster the market leader.
