Good evening Ladies and Gentelman

I'm going to win the Fraud challenge, Intensa SanPaolo Fighting Fraud with Social Proof challenge

The wining product is WebTruster

It is an API

You give it persons name, location, and all other identyfing informatiuon you have

It thinks hardly it thinks it thinks (spin around)

And then it tells you this persons trust score based on social platforms presence and online economy platofrm presence

You then use this trust score to fight in your fraud detection api
